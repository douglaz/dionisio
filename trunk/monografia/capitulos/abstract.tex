The Brazilian e-commerce has evolved in terms of services provided to the consumer. This paper presents the specification and implementation of an online recommendation system that eases the matching of a user with the most relevant products and services. Furthermore the functional and non-functional system requirements, the selected recommendation algorithms and the choices made in the implementation are described in detail.
The designed system consists of three recommendation algorithms, two of them are already widely spreaded, while the third one is new and was proposed to consider the trust among a users and their peers.
This work also includes an experiment with people interacting with the recommendation system through a social network. The analysis of the experiment is presented through graphs and statistics that compare the algorithms.
The results of the project can be applied in future development of virtual online stores and/or social networking applications.
